# Kaggle Shelter Animal Outcome Project

The main goal of the project is to come up with a model that can predict the outcome of a shelter animal given some attributes such as species, color, age, whether it has a given name or not etc. Detailed description can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes#description).

## Comment about the repository

The initial project was shared under ML_Project repository in my github. But I created a separate repository for cleaner presentation.
